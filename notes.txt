Django Rest Framework:

	* Serializers
	* Browsable API endpoint to test

Docker:
	* Isolate project dependencies
	* Deploy to cloud

Travis CI:

Test Driven Development:
	* Isolate specific codes at functions, class and api endpoints level
	* Setup dummy objects => Execution by calling the code => Assertions for the validation
	* Makes it easier to change code and saves time to identify
	* Testable, better quality test
	* Start in reverse:
		* Write the tests => Implement the code
	* Pros:
		* Increase test coverage
		* Ensure tests work
		* Encourages quality code
